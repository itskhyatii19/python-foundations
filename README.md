## Overview

This repository contains **hands-on implementations of core Python concepts**, built to establish a **strong programming foundation** for data science, machine learning, and backend development.

The focus is on:
- Writing **clean, readable Python**
- Understanding **how things work under the hood**
- Practicing **object-oriented design**
- Developing **internship-ready coding habits**

This repository intentionally avoids frameworks and abstractions to emphasize **fundamentals first**.

---

## Purpose

- Strengthen core Python concepts
- Practice writing modular and reusable code
- Build confidence with OOP and Python internals
- Prepare a solid base for ML, data processing, and backend work

```
### Learning Approach
```text
-Each file focuses on one clear concept
-Code written from scratch without shortcuts
-Emphasis on clarity over cleverness
-Concepts reinforced through implementation, not theory alone
-Structured to support gradual progression into ML and backend systems
```
### What This Repository Demonstrates
```text
-Strong Python fundamentals
-Solid understanding of OOP principles
-Ability to structure code logically
-Comfort with debugging and error handling
-Readiness to work with larger codebases
```
### How This Fits in My Portfolio
```text
This repository forms the foundation layer of my learning path:
Python Foundations → Core language & OOP
Machine Learning – Core Concepts → ML fundamentals
Student Performance ML → End-to-end ML pipeline
Smart Resume Matcher → Applied ML + system design
Flask Auth API → Backend engineering
```
### Future Extensions
